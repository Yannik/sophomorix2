This is the todo/changelog for the sophomorix sourcecode

##########  todo ##########

sophomorix-repair (seems ok so far)


sophomorix-quota

   - limit sophomorix-quota to (option names as in sophomotix-add) 
       - class(-c), 
       - project(-p), 
       - school(schoolname), ...


sophomorix-teach-in (seems ok so far)


sophomorix-check

   - what about the shell (/bin/bash) when updating from old files?
   - what about the quota  when updating from old files?
   - add more auto-teach-in

sophomorix-split

   - sophomorix-split options: 
        split randomly in 2,3 halves
        split half-half
        split a class into projects(is this necessary?)


sophomorix-passwd

   - new command sophomorix-passwd (for root)
       - new passwords for all
       - new password for classes
       - generate login-cards automatically


sophomorix-print

   - print subclass on login-card
   - what about projects, show project membership?
   - make configurable which print-output sophomorix-print generates 
     to save time (ps, pdf,csv,...) 


sophomorix-project
   - add status stuff to projects
   - check if loginname is valid before adding user to a project   


sophomorix-update(sophomorix-vampire?):

   - write script to update
     problem id of lehrer on debian is 105 ml 2.x is 1002
       -- workaround
          0. install sophomorix2
          1. groupdel lehrer (removes 105), works only when no teacher exists
          2. sophomorix-setup (repairs directories with groupowner lehrer)
          3. update (lehrer with old id will be created automatically)



All Scripts:
   - remove database/sys dependant code
   - set/check file-permissions at the and of each sophomorix-* run. 
   - shorter verbosity when no verbosity option is given
   - remove old subclass stuff (extrafile to specify subclass)
   - get_xxx functions of sophomorix-repair: give a international name 
     and put it to SophomorixAPI, document it with perldoc 
   - unify the options for all scripts (create rfc), where a common
     naming system is used, i.e what options are used to refer to a AdminClass:
         -c AdminClass --class AdminClass --adminclass AdminClass
         ...

Think about:

   - think about grpquota in projects
   - think about file-locking
