Readme how to translate manpages:

This a reminder for ME how to write and organize the manpages,
and a short introduction for YOU, if you want to translate manpages
of sophomorix to another language.


1. manpages are stored in the directory
   
    CVS-SOURCE/sophomorix-package/man/language/

    where CVS-SOURCE is currently sophomorix2

    where package is the name of the sophomorix-subpackage, 
       i.e. base, files, developer, ...

    and language is a two letter abbreviation of the language,
       i.e. de, en, ..


2. I'm writing the manpages in german(de), and most likely will
   translate them into english(en)


3. If you want to translate the manpages to another language,
   you need CVS-access or translate the manpage and send it to me.
   (you find my email-address in the scripts)


4. If you tell me that the manpages are perfect for release, give me 
   a note and I will include it in the Debian-Package.

   Please do NOT edit debian/rules by yourself!


5. To work with manpages I suggest you to use an editor with 
   syntax-highlighting (emacs, vim, ...).

   To view the formatted manpages use:

    man -l manpage.de.8

6. Manpages are handled like this in the sophomorix-packages
   - they are NOT installed with the makefile
   - they are installed with debian/rules:

        1. create a manmage  command.de.8  (replace de with en,...)
           in the subpackage in which the documented command is

        2. the .TH-line of the manpage should look like this:

           .TH COMMAND 8

           the section in .TH and the sectionnumber in the filename 
           have to be identical.

        3. put the following line in debian/rules:

           dh_installman -ppackage package/path/to/man/sophomorix-project.de.8

        4. debian installs it in the correct location
